 What is React Hooks?
React Hooks is a special function that allows us to do few things like using states or life-cycle methods etc. inside the functional components that we use inside the class components. We usually achieve this by using the following three functions,
UseState() -> to use state within the functional components.
UseEffect() -> to run the code, when a component renders or re-renders.
UseContext() -> allows us to use contexts in a functional component

iii. What is Reducer?
If you are familiar with Redux, then you must have heard about Reducer. Reducer takes two parameters, 
which are action and state. It actually acts as a manipulator that manipulates the state whenever an action is dispatched, 
depending on which type of action is being dispatched such as storing a data by adding the input fields value to state on clicking the Submit button.
